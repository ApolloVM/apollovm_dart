## 0.0.11

- Renamed:
  - `ASTCodeBlock` -> `ASTBlock`. 
  - `ASTCodeRoot` -> `ASTRoot`.
  - `ASTCodeClass` -> `ASTClass`.
- Added support to `async` calls in `ASTNode` execution.
  - Any part of an `ASTNode` can have an `async` resolution.
    This allows the mapping of external functions that
    returns a `Future` or other languages that accepts
    `async` at any point.
- Better mapping of external functions:
  - Better Identification of number of parameters of mapped
    functions.
- Now an `ASTRoot` or an `ASTClass` are initialized:
  - Class/Root statements are executed once, and a context for
    each Class/Root is held during VM execution.
